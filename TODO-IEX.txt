(1) IEX inferences should not use instantiation lemmas from currently subsumed quantifiers? Or alternatively, they could be automatically tightened by the subsuming quantified formula. 
(2) IEX inferences could search for instantiation lemmas that don't exist that could have propagated a ground literal
(3) Propagating instances can be inputs to the IEX procedure.
(4) We should catch other forms of conflicts:  ground UF conflicts? Boolean conflicts? One idea: on E-matching rounds, calculate the (SAT/ground UF) conflict before sending out the instantiations?
(5) Make a fast subsumption module for finding subsumptions.
(6) Locally process parts of IEX proofs that are useful but not in the overall proof.
(7) ground UF proof generalization
(8) compress path to UPG (subsume all quantified formulas on the path).  (IMPLEMENTED, not enabled by default)
