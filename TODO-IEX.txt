(1) IEX inferences should not use instantiation lemmas from currently subsumed quantifiers? Or alternatively, they could be automatically tightened by the subsuming quantified formula. '
->
(2) IEX inferences could search for instantiation lemmas that don't exist that could have propagated a ground literal
-> POSSIBLY NOT A GOOD IDEA. This abandons being purely "conflict driven". It is akin to trying to do arbitrary first-order resolution (i.e. selected literals).
(3) Propagating instances can be inputs to the IEX procedure. 
-> IN PROGRESS: run procedure for any quantified formula
(4) We should catch other forms of conflicts:  ground UF conflicts? Boolean conflicts? One idea: on E-matching rounds, calculate the (SAT/ground UF) conflict before sending out the instantiations?
-> IN PROGRESS: run procedure for any quantified formula
(5) Make a fast subsumption module for finding subsumptions.
-> 
(6) Locally process parts of IEX proofs that are useful but not in the overall proof.
-> IMPLEMENTED.
(7) ground UF proof generalization
-> BRAINSTORMING
(8) compress path to UPG (subsume all quantified formulas on the path).  
-> IMPLEMENTED, not enabled by default.
(9) factoring: close assertions that are subsumed by another open leaf
->
(10) automatic computed propagations from arbitrary instantiations, plug back into entailment tests
->
(11) immediately strengthen instantiation lemmas
