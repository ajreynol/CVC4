Exceptions
==========

The CVC5 API communicates certain errors using exceptions. We broadly
distinguish two types of exceptions: :cpp:class:`CVC4ApiException
<cvc5::api::CVC4ApiException>` and :cpp:class:`CVC4ApiRecoverableException
<cvc5::api::CVC4ApiRecoverableException>` (which is derived from
:cpp:class:`CVC4ApiException <cvc5::api::CVC4ApiException>`).

If any method fails with a :cpp:class:`CVC4ApiRecoverableException
<cvc5::api::CVC4ApiRecoverableException>`, the solver behaves as if the failing
method was not called. The solver can still be used safely.

If, however, a method fails with a :cpp:class:`CVC4ApiException
<cvc5::api::CVC4ApiException>`, the associated object may be in an unsafe state
and it should no longer be used.
