 * A layer on top of an EqualityEngine. The goal of this class is manage the
 * use of an EqualityEngine object in such a way that the proper proofs are
 * internally constructed, and can be retrieved from this class when
 * necessary.
 *
 * It tracks the reason for why all facts are added to an EqualityEngine in a
 * SAT-context dependent manner in a context-dependent (CDProof) object.
 *
 * It is an eager proof generator (see theory/proof_generator.h), in that
 * it stores (copies) of proofs for lemmas at the moment they are sent out.
 *
 * A theory that is proof producing and uses the equality engine may use this
 * class to manage proofs that are justified by its underlying equality engine.

   * We provide the explanation in two parts:
   * (1) exp \ noExplain, which are literals that hold in the equality engine of
   * this class,
   * (2) noExplain, which do not necessarily hold in the equality engine of this
   * class.
   * Notice that noExplain is a subset of exp.
   *
   * The proof for conc follows from exp ^ expn by proof rule with the given
   * id and arguments.
   *
   * This call corresponds to a lemma if conc is false and expn is empty.
   *
   * This returns the TrustNode corresponding to the formula corresonding to
   * the call to this method [*], for which a proof can be provided by this
   * generator in the remainder of the user context.
   *
   * [*]
   * a. If this call does not correspond to a conflict, then this formula is:
   *   ( ^_{e in exp} <explain>(e) ^ expn ) => conc
   * where <explain>(e) is a conjunction of literals L1 ^ ... ^ Ln such that
   * L1 ^ ... ^ Ln entail e, and each Li was passed as an argument to
   * assertAssume(...) in the current SAT context. This explanation method
   * always succeeds, provided that e is a literal that currently holds in
   * the equality engine of this class. Notice that if the antecedant is empty,
   * the formula above is assumed to be conc itself. The above formula is
   * intended to be valid in Theory that owns this class.
   * b. If this call is a conflict, then this formula is:
   *   ^_{e in exp} <explain>(e)
   * The above formula is intended to be equivalent to false according to the
   * Theory that owns this class.
