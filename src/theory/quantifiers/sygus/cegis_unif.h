/** Synthesizes functions in a data-driven SyGuS approach
 *
 * Data is derived from refinement lemmas generated through the regular CEGIS
 * approach. SyGuS is used to generate terms for classifying the data
 * (e.g. using decision tree learning) and thus generate a candidate for a
 * function-to-synthesize.
 *
 * This approach is inspired by the divide and conquer synthesis through
 * unification approach by Alur et al. TACAS 2017, by ICE-based invariant
 * synthesis from Garg et al. CAV 2014 and POPL 2016, and Padhi et al. PLDI 2016
 *
 * This module mantains a function-to-synthesize and a set of term
 * enumerators. When new terms are enumerated it tries to learn a new candidate
 * function, which is verified outside this module. If verification fails a
 * refinement lemma is generated, which this module sends to the utility that
 * learns candidates.

   * This function relies on a data-driven unification-based approach for
   * constructing a solutions for the function-to-synthesize. See SygusUnifRl
   * for more details.
   *
   * Calls to this function are such that terms is the list of active
   * enumerators (returned by getTermList), and term_values are their current
   * model values. This function registers { terms -> terms_values } in
   * the database of values that have been enumerated, which are in turn used
   * for constructing candidate solutions when possible.
   *
   * This function also excludes models where (terms = terms_values) by adding
   * blocking clauses to lems. For example, for grammar:
   *   A -> A+A | x | 1 | 0
   * and a call where terms = { d } and term_values = { +( x, 1 ) }, it adds:
   *   ~G V ~is_+( d ) V ~is_x( d.1 ) V ~is_1( d.2 )
   * to lems, where G is active guard of the enumerator d (see
   * TermDatabaseSygus::getActiveGuardForEnumerator). This blocking clause
   * indicates that d should not be given the model value +( x, 1 ) anymore,
   * since { d -> +( x, 1 ) } has now been added to the database of this class.

  /** Communicate refinement lemma to unification utility and external modules
   *
   * For the lemma to be sent to the external modules it adds a guard from the
   * parent conjecture which establishes that if the conjecture has a solution
   * then it must satisfy this refinement lemma
   *
   * For the lemma to be sent to the unification utility it purifies the
   * arguments of the function-to-synthensize such that all of its applications
   * are over concrete values. E.g.:
   *   f(f(f(0))) > 1
   * becomes
   *   f(0) != c1 v f(c1) != c2 v f(c2) > 1
   * in which c1 and c2 are concrete integer values
   *
   * Note that the lemma is in the deep embedding, which means that the above
   * example would actually correspond to
   *   eval(d, 0) != c1 v eval(d, c1) != c2 v eval(d, c2) > 1
   * in which d is the deep embedding of the function-to-synthesize f
