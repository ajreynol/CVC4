To anonymize a benchmark, call CVC4 with:

--strings-exp --anon-str -qq

By default, the anonymizer will preserve the length of all string literals,
as well as containment relationships between them.

Length preservation can be disabled with:

--no-anon-str-preserve-lengths

Containment preservation can be disabled with:

--no-anon-str-preserve-ctn

=============================================================================

The preservation of all the above properties are approximate.

To make CVC4 put more time/effort into preserving properties, try:

--anon-str-effort=N (default 1)
--anon-str-effort-local=N (default 20)

The N above is a multiplier on how many iterations of steps of the algorithm
to run. The first makes the algorithm run N times and takes the best
solution. The second makes the algorithm consider N solutions per string
literal during the course of a run.

=============================================================================

If you wish for CVC4 to strictly preserve the relationships that are required
during anonymization, this branch supports an alternative implementation that
generates smt2 string queries. To do this, use:

--strings-exp --anon-str-query --anon-str -qq

To dump the benchmark that was generated to actually perform the 
anonymization, you can use

--strings-exp --anon-str-query --anon-str -qq --dump anonymization-benchmark

However, notice that this alternative is typically much slower than the default
configuration.
