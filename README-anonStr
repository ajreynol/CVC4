To anonymize a benchmark, call CVC4 with `--strings-exp 
--anonymize-strings -qq` (the `-qq` just suppresses a spurious "sat" 
output).

To dump the benchmark that was generated to actually perform the 
anonymization, you can use `--strings-exp --anonymize-strings -qq 
--dump anonymization-benchmark`.

By default, the anonymizer will preserve the length of the different 
string literals. This can be disabled with 
`--no-anonymize-strings-preserve-lengths`. It also preserves negative 
containment relationships, which can be disabled using 
`--no-anonymize-strings-use-distinct`.
